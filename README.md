# Website Vulnerability Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in the 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across the **admin control panel** of the Daksh Classes website. This panel contains sensitive information such as subjects, student marks, and other details. I am sure  this data is real and accessible to unauthorized users, so I decided to report it to the official team. Unfortunately, when I reached out the director assumed I was a scammer and he ignored me.

The admin page was:  
`https://dakshclasses.in/admin/dashboard.php`  

I also verified the page's functionality by checking the find result page of the students:  
`https://dakshclasses.in/find-result.php`

Although the page is still working, I want to bring this to your attention.

## Steps
1. Use Google Dorks to search for sensitive sites (e.g., admin control panels).
2. Verify if they contain any sensitive or unauthorized information.
3. Report the issue to the site owners or administrators for further action.
